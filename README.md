# IT Academy Server
This repository contains all of the frontend and backend code for the web server. This isn't intended to be private, since the website will mainly consist of just a message board and perhaps a calendar.

## TODO
---
1. Redesign frontend CSS from the ground up
2. Create calendar on landing page
3. Redesign backend web code
